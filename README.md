<h2>Colour Scheme</h2>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lcS17pO.png" alt="Colour palette used for the site">

<strong>Body Background (Light Blue - #B0D1DE):</strong> This light blue tone serves as the main background colour across the site, setting a calming and tranquil foundation. Light blue is known for its association with peace and relaxation, helping users feel at ease as they navigate mental health information.

<strong>Light Background (Periwinkle - #CCDCFF):</strong> This soft, periwinkle blue offers a gentle contrast to the body background, creating subtle visual separation for sections without feeling harsh or distracting. Periwinkle combines the serenity of blue with a hint of energy from violet, balancing calmness with a welcoming feel.

<strong>Dark Background (Cello - #1D3752):</strong> This deep blue tone is used as an alternate background with white text to provide contrast between sections on the site. Dark blue is often associated with trust and reliability, conveying a sense of safety and authority that’s important for a mental health site.

<strong>Light Text (White - #ffffff):</strong> White text contrasts cleanly against the dark background areas, ensuring high readability for key information. White, as a neutral tone, adds a sense of clarity and space.

<strong>Dark Text (Black - #000000):</strong> Black text is used against lighter backgrounds to maintain strong readability and contrast, balancing the design with a clear and direct visual impact.

By combining calming blues with balanced neutrals, this colour scheme reinforces the site’s mission to provide a professional, yet soothing user experience that encourages users to feel comfortable exploring mental health topics.

<h2>Colour Contrast Checks</h2>

The background and foreground combinations have been tested for good colour contrast.

<h2>Typography</h2>

<strong>Serif Font (‘Merriweather’):</strong> The Merriweather serif font brings a classic, approachable feel to headers or highlighted text, giving a touch of warmth and readability. Its slight elegance fits well with the professional tone, while remaining soft and welcoming.

<strong>Sans-Serif Font (‘Roboto’):</strong> Roboto is used for the main body text, providing clarity and modernity in a straightforward, highly readable style. As a sans-serif font, it maintains a clean, accessible look, perfect for easily digesting information.

<h2>Notable Deviations from Wireframes in Final Design</h2>

<p>The hero section has the carousel for positive affirmations displaying directly over it instead of being positioned along the bottom of the div. This was done as it became clear that is was much more readable when placed on top of the hero image instead of being only partly covered.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oXqVLkh.png" alt="Hero section showing the positive affirmation carousel">

<p>In the resources section the scaling on medium screens (tablets and up) was changed to remain as col-md-12 for the first six cards and col-md-4 for the mental health support group resources. The scaling of 9 cards with col-md-4 on each of them resulted in wasted space that was a poor user experience.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nlsusw1.png" alt="A view of the resource section on a responsive tablet sized screen, col-12 and col-4 cards are visible">

<p>An additional navigation item has been added for 'Articles'. This was to better segment the page.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F9lDSy1.png" alt="Navbar showing all links for the website">

<p>Additional headings added to distinguish popular articles and all articles. The border was extended around the popular article carousel to include the header.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qnqzCEo.png" alt="The news and updates section showing the different headings">

<p>Articles have had a publish date included in them. Images are also included that are not present on the wireframes.</p>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
In future iterations, additional features could include interactive elements, such as a quiz to help users assess stress levels, or a comments section where users can share experiences and tips.

<h2>Validation, Accessibility and Performance</h2>

A number of tools have been used to make sure that the HTML and CSS for the site is without errors.

Unfortunately the embedded YouTube videos and carousels are having a noticeable impact on the scores for page performance and best practices. Steps have been taken to reduce the impact by using lazy loading and YouTube's suggested embed code. <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed" target="_blank">lite-youtube-embed</a> was considered but since it's not just using HTML and CSS it sits outside the scope of this project.
